## Example Use Cases

Here are some examples of what you can ask Suna to do:

### Research and Analysis
```
Analyze the market for my next company in the healthcare industry, located in the UK. Give me the major players, their market size, strengths, and weaknesses, and add their website URLs. Once done, generate a PDF report.
```

### Data Processing
```
My company asked me to set up an Excel spreadsheet with all the information about Italian lottery games (Lotto, 10eLotto, and Million Day). Based on that, generate and send me a spreadsheet with all the basic information.
```

### Trip Planning
```
Generate a personal trip to London, with departure from Bangkok on the 1st of May. The trip will last 10 days. Find accommodation in the center of London, with a rating on Google reviews of at least 4.5.
```

### LinkedIn Research
```
Go on LinkedIn, and find me 10 profiles available - they are not working right now - for a junior software engineer position, who are located in Munich, Germany.
```

## Configuration

### Connection Settings

- **Suna API URL**: The base URL of your Suna instance
  - Local: `http://localhost:8000`
  - Remote: `https://your-suna-instance.com`

- **API Key**: Optional authentication token
  - Required only if your Suna instance has authentication enabled
  - Leave blank for open instances

### File Attachments

The client supports attaching various file types:
- Text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`)
- Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`)
- Documents (`.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`)
- Code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.xml`)
- Any other file type

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Enter` - Send message
- `Escape` - Clear message input (when focused)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **"Connection failed - API not responding"**
   - Verify Suna is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
   - Check the URL is correct
   - Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if the Suna instance requires authentication

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow responses**
   - This is normal for complex tasks (research, analysis, file processing)
   - Suna may be performing browser automation or API calls
   - Wait for the process to complete or use "Stop Agent" if needed

2. **Large file uploads**
   - Large files may take time to upload
   - Consider breaking down large datasets into smaller files

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to initiate agent"**: Check your Suna instance has sufficient resources
- **"Streaming failed"**: Network connectivity issue or agent stopped unexpectedly
- **"Agent run not found"**: The agent process may have crashed or been terminated

## Development

To modify or extend the client:

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install development dependencies**
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test with a local Suna instance**

The client is built with:
- **tkinter** for the GUI (included with Python)
- **requests** for HTTP communication
- **threading** for non-blocking operations
- **queue** for thread-safe communication

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store securely and don't share
- **File Uploads**: Be cautious with sensitive files
- **Network**: Use HTTPS for remote connections when possible
- **Local Instance**: Consider firewall rules for local Suna instances
